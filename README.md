# Guess-the-Number-Java-guessing-game
This is A simple Java application that I created to allow the user to pick a number between 1 and 10
if the user guesses too high, the program will prompt the user to try again
if the user guesses too low, the program will also prompt the user too try again
the program will end when the user selects the correct answer
